        <h1>Does Syntax Need to Grow on Trees? Sources of Hierarchical Inductive Bias in Sequence-to-Sequence Networks</h1>

        <p><em>This page provides the full data for the paper found here. The code is available here.</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction: Inductive biases</h2>

        <p>Consider the miniature experiment below: Two learners are shown a set of training examples which are consistent with multiple possible rules. When the learners are asked to generalize to a novel example, their responses reveal that they have learned different rules. These differences cannot be due to the training data, because both learners have seen the same training data. Instead, the differences must be due to some property of the learners. The properties that determine how a learner generalizes from ambiguous data are called <b>inductive biases</b>. In this case, the learner on the left has an inductive bias favoring generalizations based on shape, while the learner on the right has an inductive bias favoring generalizations based on color. </p>
        

        <div style="margin:auto; width:50%"><img src="shape_bias.png" width=100%></div>


        <p>What properties of a learner cause it to have one inductive bias rather than another? We study this question using several types of sequence-to-sequence neural networks, which are models that transform one sequence into another (in our case, the models are transforming one sentence into another sentence). We focus on one particular bias, namely a bias for generalizations based on hierarchical structure, since such a <b>hierarchical bias</b> has long been argued to play a central role in children's acquisition of language. Understanding this bias can therefore lend insight into human language acquisition and can also help us create models of language that generalize better to novel syntactic structures.</p>
        
        <p>To investigate which types of models have a hierarchical bias, we use two tasks based on English syntax: <b>question formation</b> (that is, mapping a declarative sentence to a yes/no question) and <b>tense reinflection</b> (that is, mapping a past-tense sentence to a present-tense sentence). The following diagrams illustrate the experimental setups for these two tasks:</p>

        <div style="margin:auto; width:100%"><img src="question_formation_setup.png" width=50% style="vertical-align: text-top"><img src="tense_reinflection_setup.png" width=50% style="vertical-align: text-top"></div>

        <p>For both of these tasks, we constrain the training set to be consistent with a generalization based on hierarchical structure and a generalization based on linear order. We then evaluate our models on examples that disambiguate these two types of generalizations to see which one each model has learned. If a model behaves consistently with the hierarchical generalization for both tasks, we would then have converging evidence to conclude that the model has a hierarchical bias.</p>

        <h2>Tasks and evaluation metrics</h2>

        <h3>Question formation</h3>

        <p>English question formation involves the movement of an auxiliary verb to the front of the sentence, such as transforming <em>My walrus does giggle</em> into <em>Does my walrus giggle?</em>. Simple examples like that one are consistent with two possible rules, a hierarchical rule called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span> and a linear rule called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span>:

        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main:</span> move the main auxiliary to the front of the sentence.</li>
            <li><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First:</span> move the first auxiliary to the front of the sentence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All of our training and evaluation examples are generated from a context-free grammar with a vocabulary size of 75 words. We use this grammar to generate a training set and a test set that are both ambiguous between <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span> as well as a generalization set composed of examples where the two rules make different predictions, such as the following:</p>


        <ul>
            <li><b>Input declarative sentence:</b> &nbsp;My walrus that <span style="color: blue;"><b>doesn't</b></span> giggle <span style="color: green;"><b>does</b></span> laugh.</li>
            <li><b>Prediction of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span>:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;"><b>Does</b></span> my walrus that <span style="color: blue;"><b>doesn't</b></span> giggle ___ laugh?</li>
            <li><b>Prediction of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span>:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: blue;"><b>Doesn't</b></span> my walrus that ___ giggle <span style="color: green;"><b>does</b></span> laugh?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We use two major evaluation metrics. The first is <b>test set full-sentence accuracy</b>. That is, for examples drawn from the same distribution as the training examples, does the model get the output exactly right, word for word?</p>

        <p>For testing generalization to the withheld example type, a natural metric would be full-sentence accuracy on the generalization set. However, in preliminary experiments we found that most models rarely produced the exact output predicted by either <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span>, as they tend to truncate the output, confuse similar words, and make other extraneous errors. To abstract away from such errors, we use <b>generalization set first-word accuracy</b>, which is the proportion of outputs for which the model produced the correct first word. Under both <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span>, the first word of the output is the auxiliary that has been moved from within the sentence. If the main auxiliary and the first auxiliary are different, this word alone is sufficient to distinguish the two rules. For example, in the example above, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span> predicts a first word of <em>does</em> while <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span> predicts <em>doesn't</em>. To make this metric valid, therefore, we exclude cases where the two auxiliaries are the same.</p>


        <p>There has been a long and lively debate in linguistics about English question formation. Chomsky (1965, 1980) argued that the input to children acquiring English is ambiguous between <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span> but that all English speakers nevertheless acquire <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span>, which he uses to argue that humans must have a hierarchical bias. Both the empirical basis of this argument and its conclusion have been debated extensively; see our paper for more discussion of the debate. In this work, we do not directly study human language acquisition but instead investigate which computational models have a hierarchical bias so that we can better understand under what conditions learners will learn <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span>. In the discussion of our paper, we touch on how our findings relate to the debate about human language acquisition.</p>

        
        <h3>Tense reinflection</h3>

        <p>Our second task, tense reinflection, is the transformation of a past-tense English sentence to a present-tense English sentence, such as turning <em>Her vultures swam</em> into <em>Her vultures swim</em>. The critical part of this task is determining what form the verb should take, as a given past-tense verb in English (such as <em>swam</em>) could be the past tense of either a singular present-tense verb (<em>swims</em>) or a plural present-tense verb (<em>swim</em>). Simple examples such as that one are consistent with two rules, a hierarchical rule called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Subject</span> and a linear rule called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Recent</span>:

        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Subject:</span> a verb agrees with its subject</li>
            <li><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Recent:</span> a verb agrees with the most recent noun before it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We create a training set and a test set that are both ambiguous between <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Subject</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Recent</span> as well as a generalization set composed of examples where the two rules make different predictions, such as the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Input declarative sentence:</b> &nbsp;Her <span style="color: blue;"><b>unicorns</b></span> near the <span style="color: green;"><b>salamander</b></span> swam.</li>
            <li><b>Prediction of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Subject</span>:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her <span style="color: blue;"><b>unicorns</b></span> near the <span style="color: green;"><b>salamander</b></span> <span style="color: blue;"><b>swim</b></span>.</li>
            <li><b>Prediction of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Recent</span>:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her <span style="color: blue;"><b>unicorns</b></span> near the <span style="color: green;"><b>salamander</b></span> <span style="color: green;"><b>swims</b></span>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As with the question-formation task, we evaluate test set performance with <b>test set full-sentence accuracy</b>. For evaluating generalization performance, we use <b>generalization set main-verb accuracy</b>, which is the proportion of outputs for which the main verb was predicted correctly (such as predicting <em>swim</em> instead of <em>swims</em> in the example above.


        <h3>Other evaluation metrics</h3>

        <p>Most of our discussion in this website uses the 3 metrics mentioned above (test set full-sentence accuracy, generalization set first-word accuracy, and generalization set main-verb accuracy), but in case you want to delve deeper into the results we also provide results for several other metrics, which we describe here. If you just want the gist of the website, you can skip this section (or come back to it if there is a particular metric you are interested in), but if you want to read about the other metrics you should click this button to make them visible: <input type="checkbox" id="all_metrics_btn" onclick="toggle_all_metrics()"></p>

        <div id="all_metrics">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Metrics used for both tasks:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Test set full-sentence accuracy:</em> The proportion of test set examples for which the output is exactly correct, word for word.</li>
                <li><em>Test set full-sentence part-of-speech accuracy:</em> The proportion of test set examples for which the output has the correct sequence of parts of speech. For example, if the correct output is <em>Does the walrus laugh?</em>, this metric would count <em>Doesn't your salamanders run?</em> as correct.</li>
                <li><em>Generalization set full-sentence accuracy:</em> The proportion of generalization set examples for which the output is exactly correct, word for word.</li>
                <li><em>Generalization set full-sentence part-of-speech accuracy</em>: The proportion of generalization set examples for which the output has the correct sequence of parts of speech.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Question formation metrics:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>First-word metrics of accuracy:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: first word = main auxiliary</em>: The proportion of outputs in which the first word is the main auxiliary from the input; e.g., if the input were <em>My walrus that the yaks do see doesn't giggle</em>, this metric would count <em>Doesn't my walrus that the yaks?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: first word = first auxiliary</em>: The proportion of outputs in which the first word is the first auxiliary from the input; e.g., if the input were <em>My walrus that the yaks do see doesn't giggle</em>, this metric would count <em>Do my walrus that the yaks?</em>. We constrain the generalization set such that the first auxiliary is never the main auxiliary, so any output that satisfies this metric will be incorrect.</li> 
                    <li><em>Generalization set: first word = auxiliary not in input</em>: The proportion of outputs in which the first word is an auxiliary that did not appear in the input; e.g., if the input were <em>My walrus that the yaks do see doesn't giggle</em>, this metric would count <em>Don't my walrus that the yaks?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: first word = non-auxiliary</em>: The proportion of outputs in which the first word is not an auxiliary; e.g., if the input were <em>My walrus that the yaks do see doesn't giggle</em>, this metric would count <em>the my walrus that ravens the yaks?</em>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Breakdown by relative clause type:</b> Every sentence in the generalization set has a relative clause modifying its subject, while the training set does not contain any question-formation examples with relative clauses on the subjects. The following metrics break down the generalization set first-word accuracy based on the type of relative clause that is used:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Generalization set first-word accuracy with object relative clause on subject</em>: The first-word accuracy on the subset of the generalization set where the relative clause modifying the subject is an object relative clause (that is, a relative clause for which the constituent moved out of the relative clause is the object of the verb), such as <em>that the walruses do visit</em> or <em>who my raven doesn't see</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set first-word accuracy with transitive subject relative clause on subject</em>: The first-word accuracy on the subset of the generalization set where the relative clause modifying the subject is an subject relative clause (that is, a relative clause for which the constituent moved out of the relative clause is the subject of the verb) with a transitive verb, such as <em>that does visit my walruses</em> or <em>who doesn't see my raven</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set first-word accuracy with intransitive subject relative clause on subject</em>: The first-word accuracy on the subset of the generalization set where the relative clause modifying the subject is an subject relative clause (that is, a relative clause for which the constituent moved out of the relative clause is the subject of the verb) with an intransitive verb, such as <em>that does laugh</em> or <em>who doesn't giggle</em>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Finer-grained output categorization:</b> Most of the generalization set metrics considered so far only look at the first word of the output, but we use the following metrics to characterize the entire generalization set output. To do so, we frame question formation as having two parts: Placing an auxiliary at the front of the sentence, and deleting an auxiliary from within the sentence. The correct procedure would be to prepose the second auxiliary and also delete the second auxiliary (since, in our particular examples, the second auxiliary is always the main auxiliary), but a model could conceivably follow another procedure such as preposing the first auxiliary and deleting no auxiliary. Here we classify outputs based on which auxiliary was preposed (the first auxiliary, the second auxiliary, or another auxiliary that was not in the input) and which auxiliary was deleted (the first auxiliary, the second auxiliary, or neither):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Delete first, prepose first</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this would generate <em>Does my walrus that laugh doesn't giggle?</em>. (This is equivalent to <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-First</span>).</li>
                    <li><em>Delete first, prepose second</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this would generate <em>Doesn't my walrus that laugh doesn't giggle?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Delete first, prepose other</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this might generate <em>Do my walrus that laugh doesn't giggle?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Delete second, prepose first</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this would generate <em>Does my walrus that does laugh giggle?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Delete second, prepose second</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this would generate <em>Doesn't my walrus that does laugh giggle?</em>. (This is the correct strategy, corresponding to <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Move-Main</span>).</li>
                    <li><em>Delete second, prepose other</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this might generate <em>Don't my walrus that does laugh giggle?</em>.</li> 
                    <li><em>Delete none, prepose first</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this would generate <em>Does my walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Delete none, prepose second</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this would generate <em>Doesn't my walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Delete none, prepose other</em>: For the input <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em>, this might generate <em>Do my walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle?</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Other</em>: Many outputs do not fit into any of the above categories and so get thrust into this category of <em>other</em>. Types of errors involved in this category include truncation of the output, swapping a word for another word of the same part of speech (e.g., <em>yak</em> instead of <em>walrus</em>), or changing a relative clause to a prepositional phrase (e.g., if the correct output is <em>Does her salamander that some tyrannosaurus doesn't admire confuse your xylophones below some salamander ?</em>, a model might generate <em>Doesn't her salamander around some tyrannosaurus admire your salamander that does confuse some tyrannosaurus ?</em>).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Tense reinflection metrics:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Generalization set full-sentence consistent with agree-recent:</em>The proportion of generalization set outputs that are exactly the output predicted by <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Agree-Recent</span>. For example, for the input <em>My walrus by the peacocks visited the yak that laughed</em>, this metric would count <em>My walrus by the peacocks visit the yak that laughs</em>.</li>
                <li><b>Main-verb metrics of accuracy:</b> Note that a particular output may not be counted by any of these four metrics if its sequence of parts of speech is incorrect. In practice, this rarely happens for the tense reinflection task.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: correct main verb (with correct agreement):</em> The proportion of generalization set examples for which the output has the correct sequence of parts of speech and has the correct word in the main verb position (the restriction on parts of speech is imposed so that we can unambiguously identify the position that should be the main verb). For example, if the input is <em>My walrus by the peacocks visited the yak</em>, this metric would count as correct <em>My walrus by the peacocks visits the yak</em> and <em>Some raven near your orangutans visits some quail</em>, but not <em>My walrus visits the yak</em> (wrong sequence of parts of speech) or <em>My walrus by the peacocks visit the yak</em> (wrong number on the main verb).</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: correct main verb stem but incorrect agreement:</em> The proportion of generalization set examples for which the output has the correct sequence of parts of speech and has the correct stem in the main verb position but with the incorrect agreement (i.e., the verb is singular when it should be plural, or vice versa). For example, if the input is <em>My walrus by the peacocks visited the yak</em>, this metric would count <em>My walrus by the peacocks visit the yak</em> and <em>Some raven near your orangutans visit some quail</em>, but not <em>My walrus visit the yak</em> (wrong sequence of parts of speech) or <em>My walrus by the peacocks visits the yak</em> (correct number on the main verb).</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: correct main verb number </em> The proportion of generalization set examples for which the output has the correct sequence of parts of speech and has the correct number for the word in the main verb position. For example, if the input is <em>My walrus by the peacocks visited the yak</em>, this metric would count <em>My walrus by the peacocks visits the yak</em> and <em>Some raven near your orangutans sees some quail</em>, but not <em>My walrus visits the yak</em> (wrong sequence of parts of speech) or <em>My walrus by the peacocks see the yak</em> (incorrect number on the main verb).</li>
                    <li><em>Generalization set: incorrect main verb number </em> The proportion of generalization set examples for which the output has the correct sequence of parts of speech and has the incorrect number for the word in the main verb position. For example, if the input is <em>My walrus by the peacocks visited the yak</em>, this metric would count <em>My walrus by the peacocks visit the yak</em> and <em>Some raven near your orangutans see some quail</em>, but not <em>My walrus visit the yak</em> (wrong sequence of parts of speech) or <em>My walrus by the peacocks sees the yak</em> (correct number on the main verb).</li>

        <h2>Experiments</h2>

        <p>The rest of this website gives the complete results for the experiments described in the paper. For each experiment, we ran 100 re-runs of each model involved to control for variation across restarts. Each section contains a table listing the results for all re-runs of all models as well as a boxplot that you can use to  visualize the distribution across re-runs (the boxplots display the minimum, the lower fence, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, the upper fence, the maximum, and any outliers. The upper and lower fences are defined as the points that are 1.5 times the interquartile range outside of the middle 50% of the data). Both the tables and the boxplots can be customized by clicking the buttons near them. 


        <h2>Variants of sequential RNNs</h2>

        <h3>Comparing recurrent units and attention variants</h3>

        <div style="margin:auto; width:100%"><img src="seq2seq.png" width=100%></div>


        <p>First we trained several types of sequential RNNs on both tasks. The basic structure of this model is illustrated above: First, a component called the encoder reads in the input sequence one word at a time, from left to right, to construct a single vector (E6 in the image) that encodes the input. A second component called the decoder then takes this encoding vector as input and outputs one word at a time to create the output, stopping when it generates a punctuation mark. We vary two aspects of the architecture: the recurrent unit (SRN, GRU, or LSTM; the recurrent unit is the component that updates the hidden state of the model from time step to time step), and the type of attention that was used (no attention, location-based attention, or content-based attention; attention is a mechanism that allows the decoder to peek back at the encoder). The table and boxplot below show the effects of these factors.</p>

                Similar errors were also observed by Frank and Mathis 2007.</li>
            <li>All other model types had high test-set full-sentence accuracy on both tasks, showing that they have mastered the types of examples they have been trained on.

            <li>The most important consideration is how models generalize to novel types of examples. First, note that there is considerable variability on this front; e.g., the SRN with content-based attention ranged from 0.17 to 0.90 (<span class="demo" onclick="tab1 = tab1_question;document.getElementById('qf_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p1_dataset = experiments_1;  set_param(tab1_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'SRN', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'SRN', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_question, 'attn', 'Content', 'qf_attn_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'attn', 'Content', 'qf_attn_btn'); draw_p1_boxplot(p1_boxplot_metric); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_question'; hide('columns_p1_tense'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab1, 'p1question'); table_1_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_attn_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_gen_main_btn.checked = true;  drawTable(tab1); p1question_gen_main.checked = true; draw_p1_boxplot('gen_main'); ">click here to see in plot</span>) (cf. McCoy, Min, and Linzen 2019). To understand models' typical behavior, we consider the median across all 100 initializations.</li>
            <li>Considered in this way, there are two models that exhibited a preference for move-main over move-first, as evidenced by having a median first-word generalization set accuracy above 50% (which is chance): The SRN with content-based attention and the GRU with position-based attention.(<span class="demo" onclick="tab1 = tab1_question;document.getElementById('qf_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p1_dataset = experiments_1;  set_param(tab1_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_question, 'attn', 'Any attention', 'qf_attn_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'attn', 'Any attention', 'qf_attn_btn'); draw_p1_boxplot(p1_boxplot_metric); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_question'; hide('columns_p1_tense'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab1, 'p1question'); table_1_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_attn_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_gen_main_btn.checked = true;  drawTable(tab1); p1question_gen_main.checked = true; draw_p1_boxplot('gen_main'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)  </li>
            <li>However, there is reason to believe that these models have not actually learned hierarchical transformations. The bullets above only considered first-word accuracy on the generalization set, as the full-sentence outputs are often messy. However, if we do look at the specific types of outputs given by the GRU with location-based attention, we see that its most common output type is dnp2 - which is hierarchical in nature. However, it does often have outputs of types that are not hierarchical (Crain and Nakayama, Ambridge et al).(<span class="demo" onclick="tab1 = tab1_question; document.getElementById('qf_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p1_dataset = experiments_1;  set_param(tab1_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'GRU', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'GRU', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_question, 'attn', 'Location', 'qf_attn_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'attn', 'Location', 'qf_attn_btn'); draw_p1_boxplot(p1_boxplot_metric); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_question'; hide('columns_p1_tense'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab1, 'p1question'); table_1_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_attn_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_d1p1_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_d1p2_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_d1po_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_d2p1_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_d2p2_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_d2po_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_dnp1_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_dnp2_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_dnpo_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_other_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab1); p1question_d1p1.checked = true; p1question_d1p2.checked = true; p1question_d1po.checked = true; p1question_d2p1.checked = true; p1question_d2p2.checked = true; p1question_d2po.checked = true; p1question_dnp1.checked = true; p1question_dnp2.checked = true; p1question_dnpo.checked = true;p1question_other.checked = true; draw_p1_boxplot('d1p1'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)</li>
            <li>As for the SRN with content-based attention, we see that it almost always gets the right first auxiliary when the RC is a subject relative clause, but almost always gets the wrong auxiliary when its an object relative clause. The internal structure of this relative clause should not matter, so the fact that it does suggests that this model category has learned some heuristic. (<span class="demo" onclick="tab1 = tab1_question;document.getElementById('qf_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p1_dataset = experiments_1;  set_param(tab1_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'SRN', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'SRN', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_question, 'attn', 'Content', 'qf_attn_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'attn', 'Content', 'qf_attn_btn'); draw_p1_boxplot(p1_boxplot_metric); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_question'; hide('columns_p1_tense'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab1, 'p1question'); table_1_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_attn_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_orc_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_srct_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_srci_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab1); p1question_orc.checked = true; p1question_srct.checked = true; p1question_srci.checked = true;  draw_p1_boxplot('d1p1'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)</li>
            <li>More generally, all of these models - including the 2 that showed hierarchical-ish behavior on question formation - behaved very linearly with tense reinflection; ignoring the SRN without attention (whose problems were discussed earlier), almost always have the linear main verb (<span class="demo" onclick="tab1 = tab1_tense;document.getElementById('qf_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Tense reinflection'; p1_dataset = experiments_1_tense;  set_param(tab1_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_question, 'attn', 'Any attention', 'qf_attn_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'attn', 'Any attention', 'qf_attn_btn'); draw_p1_boxplot(p1_boxplot_metric); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_question'; hide('columns_p1_tense'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_tense'; hide('columns_p1_question'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab1, 'p1tense'); table_1_div_tense_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_tense_attn_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_tense_gen_mv_linear_btn.checked = true;  drawTable(tab1); p1tense_gen_mv_linear.checked = true; draw_p1_boxplot('gen_mv_linear'); ">click here to see in plot</span>), and even the full output sentence is often the exact sentence predicted by agree-recent (<span class="demo" onclick="tab1 = tab1_tense;document.getElementById('qf_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Tense reinflection'; p1_dataset = experiments_1_tense;  set_param(tab1_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'qf_enc_btn'); set_param(tab1_question, 'attn', 'Any attention', 'qf_attn_btn'); set_param(tab1_tense, 'attn', 'Any attention', 'qf_attn_btn'); draw_p1_boxplot(p1_boxplot_metric); p1_column_div = 'columns_p1_tense'; hide('columns_p1_question'); toggle_p1_column(); p1_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab1, 'p1tense'); table_1_div_tense_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_tense_attn_btn.checked = true; table_1_div_tense_gen_linear_btn.checked = true;  drawTable(tab1); p1tense_gen_linear.checked = true; draw_p1_boxplot('gen_linear'); ">click here to see in plot</span>). This fact suggests that none of these 9 model types have a hierarchical bias, because if they had such a bias it should apply across training tasks; whereas we only saw it at all with question formation, and even there it is arguable. What did drive that behavior? We don't know; but work has suggested that bigram stats could drive it, so maybe these models are just manifesting such a bias, which is a reasonable one to have (indeed, such a bias would also be consistent with poor tense reinflection performance, as this is a case where bigram stats lead you astray: Getting the answer right involves generating bigrams that have never been seen before, such as "vultures amuses" in "the quail near your vultures amuses your yak.")</li>
            <li>Both recurrent unit and attention matter, as do the interactions between the two.</li>
        </ul>




        <h3>Effects of squashing</h3>

        <p>One striking result in the previous section is that LSTMs and GRUs display qualitative differences, even though the  two  architectures  are  often  viewed  as  interchangeable and achieve similar performance in applied tasks (Chung et al., 2014).   One difference between  LSTMs  and  GRUs  is  that  a  squashing function is applied to the hidden state of a GRU to keep its values within the range(−1,1), while the cell state of an LSTM is not bounded.  Weiss et al. (2018) demonstrate that such squashing leads to a qualitative difference in how well these models generalize counting behavior.  Such squashing may  also  explain  the  qualitative  differences  that we observe: counting the input elements is equivalent to keeping track of their linear positions, so we might expect that a tendency to count would make the linear generalization more accessible.</p>

        <p>To test whether squashing increases a model’s preference for MOVE-MAIN,  we created a modified LSTM that included squashing in the calculation of its cell state, and a modified GRU that did not have the squashing usually present in GRUs. Results for these models, as well as for the standard variants of the GRU and LSTM, are below.</p>

        <h3>Learning rate and hidden size</h3>

        <p>We searched over 2 hyperparameters, learning rate and hidden size, for the question formation task. We do not have hypotheses about how the learning rate would be relevant for this task, but there are plausible reasons  why  hidden  size  might  matter:   a  smaller hidden  size  might  force  a  model  to  learn  more compact  representations,  which  would  lead  to  a bias for generalizations that can be described efficiently.   For a language that can be most compactly described in hierarchical terms, such a bias would  favor MOVE-MAIN (Perfors  et  al.,  2011). On the other hand, the sequential structure of our model  is  closer  to  the  linear  structure  underlying MOVE-FIRST than the tree structure underlying MOVE-MAIN. Thus,  a  more  compressed  hidden state might bias a sequential model toward MOVE-FIRST by giving it less capacity to develop a representation that deviates from its own structure. The following plots show results of these explorations:</p>

        <p>This table shows how generalization set first-word accuracy varies with hidden size (each cell is a median over 10 restarts; 🚫 stands for no attention, 🌎 stands for location-based attention, and 📖 stands for content-based attention):</p>
        <div style="margin:auto; width:50%"><img src="hs_table.png" width=100%></div>

        <p>From this table, it appears that, for GRUs with location-based attention, greater hidden sizes are associated with higher scores. To test this more systematically, we ran 1 experiment for each of 100 hidden sizes (namely hidden sizes 60, 63, 66, ... , 354, 357), and found that there was indeed a significant positive correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.62; p &less; 10e-11):</p>
        <div style="margin:auto; width:50%"><img src="hs_scatter.png" width=100%></div>

        <p>Moreover, this correlation cannot be attributed to overall stronger performance, since test set full-sentence accuracy was <em>negatively</em> correlated with hidden size (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.56). We further ran 100 iterations for each of two hidden sizes, namely 64 and 1024, and also found a noticeable difference between the two:</p>

        <p>From this table, it appears that, for GRUs with location-based attention, greater learning rates are associated with higher scores. To test this more systematically, we ran 1 experiment for each of 100 learning rates (namely learning rates of 0.00010, 0.00012, 0.00014, ... , 0.00206, 0.00208), and found that there was indeed a significant positive correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.42; p &less; 10e-4):</p>
        <div style="margin:auto; width:50%"><img src="lr_scatter.png" width=100%></div>

        <p>Learning rate is also positively correlated with test set full-sentence accuracy; however, a likelihood ratio test shows that learning rate significantly predicts generalization set first-word accuracy beyond the effects of test set full-sentence accuracy (p &less; 10e−4).We further ran 100 iterations for each of two learning rates, namely 0.005 and 0.0005, and also found a noticeable difference between the two:</p>

        <h2>Question formation with tree-based models</h2>

        <h3>Tree-based recurrent units</h3>

        <p>So far we have tested whether properties that are not  interpretably  related  to  hierarchical  structurenevertheless affect how a model generalizes on syntactic tasks. The basic finding is that all of the factors we tested (recurrent unit, type of attention, learning rate, and hidden size) can all significantly affect a model's generalization behavior, but none of the models we tested appear to have a true hierarchical bias. We now turn to a related but opposite question:  when a model’s design is meant to give it a hierarchical inductive bias,  does this design succeed at giving the model this bias?</p>

        <p>To investigate this question, we now compare two tree-based recurrent units (ON-LSTM and Tree-GRU) to the sequential recurrent units used above, all without attention.</p>

        <p>Some highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ordered Neurons model, like all of the sequential models, strongly preferred both linear generalizations: move-main for question formation, and agree-recent for tense reinflection. This suggests that, although this model's architecture was motivated by hierarchical structure, it does not have a hierarchical bias.

            <li>The Tree-GRU, however, does display a strong preference for the hierarchical generalization on both question formation (<span class="demo" onclick="tab9 = tab9_question;document.getElementById('tree_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p9_dataset = experiments_9;  set_param(tab9_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'tree_enc_btn'); set_param(tab9_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'tree_enc_btn'); p9_column_div = 'columns_p9_question'; hide('columns_p9_tense'); toggle_p9_column(); p9_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab9, 'p9question'); table_9_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_9_div_gen_main_btn.checked = true;  table_9_div_gen_first_btn.checked = true;drawTable(tab9); p9question_gen_main.checked = true; draw_p9_boxplot('gen_main'); ">click here to see in plot</span>) and tense reinflection (<span class="demo" onclick="tab9 = tab9_tense;document.getElementById('tree_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Tense reinflection'; p9_dataset = experiments_9_tense;  set_param(tab9_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'tree_enc_btn'); set_param(tab9_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Any recurrent unit', 'tree_enc_btn'); p9_column_div = 'columns_p9_tense'; hide('columns_p9_question'); toggle_p9_column(); p9_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab9, 'p9tense'); table_9_div_tense_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_9_div_tense_gen_mv_correct_btn.checked = true;  table_9_div_tense_gen_mv_linear_btn.checked = true;drawTable(tab9); p9tense_gen_mv_correct.checked = true; draw_p9_boxplot('gen_mv_correct'); ">click here to see in plot</span>), suggesting that it does have a hierarchical bias.</li>

        <h3>Effect of encoder and decoder</h3>

        <p>All of the models we use have two components, the encoder and the decoder. So far we have only tested models where the encoder type and the decoder type match, and this has shown that models where both components are explicitly built around trees will generalize hierarchically but models where both components are sequential will not.</p>
        
        <p>Is this difference between tree-based models and sequential models due to the encoder, the decoder, or both? Here we test this using a model whose encoder is a sequential GRU but whose decoder is a Tree-GRU and a model whose encoder is a Tree-GRU but whose decoder is a sequential GRU (as well as two models from before: the model with a sequential GRU encoder and sequential GRU decoder, and the model with a Tree-GRU encoder and a Tree-GRU decoder).</p>

        <p>Some highlights:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Both models with a tree-based decoder generalized hierarchically, while both models with a sequential decoder (even the model with a Tree-GRU encoder and a sequential decoder) generalized linearly. This suggests that it is the decoder that is more important, a finding consistent with McCoy et al. 2019. (<span class="demo" onclick="set_param(tab10, 'enc', 'Any encoder', 'ed_enc_btn'); set_param(tab10, 'dec', 'Any decoder', 'ed_dec_btn'); uncheck_all(tab10, 'p10question'); table_10_div_enc_btn.checked = true; table_10_div_dec_btn.checked = true; table_10_div_gen_main_btn.checked = true;  drawTable(tab10); p10question_gen_main.checked = true; draw_p10_boxplot('gen_main'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)</li>
            <li>Of the two models with a tree-based decoder, only the model that also had a tree-based encoder achieved high full-sentence accuracy on the test set; the model with a GRU encoder and Tree decoder usually performed poorly on the test set, so the only model that performed well on the test set and generalized hierarchically was the model with a tree-based encoder and a tree-based decoder. However, note that some of the GRU/Tree models did perform well, so maybe we just need to train it longer. (<span class="demo" onclick="set_param(tab10, 'enc', 'Any encoder', 'ed_enc_btn'); set_param(tab10, 'dec', 'Any decoder', 'ed_dec_btn'); uncheck_all(tab10, 'p10question'); table_10_div_enc_btn.checked = true; table_10_div_dec_btn.checked = true; table_10_div_test_full_btn.checked = true;  drawTable(tab10); p10question_test_full.checked = true; draw_p10_boxplot('test_full'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)  </li> 
        </ul>


        <h2>Are tree models constrained to generalize hierarchically?</h2>

        <p>It may seem that the tree-based models are constrained  by  their  structure  to  make  only  hierarchical  generalizations,  rendering  their  hierarchical generalization trivial.  In this section, we test whether they are in fact constrained in this way, and similarly whether sequential models are constrained to make only linear generalizations.</p>  
        
        <p>Earlier, the training sets for our two tasks were ambiguous between two generalizations, but we now used  training  sets  that  unambiguously  supported either  a  linear  transformation  or  a  hierarchical transformation. For example, we used a MOVE-MAIN training  set  that  included  some  examples like <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em> turning into <em>Doesn't my walrus that does laugh giggle?</em>, while the MOVE-FIRST training set included some examples like  <em>My walrus that does laugh doesn't giggle</em> turning into <em>Does my walrus that laugh doesn't giggle?</em>. Similarly,  for the tense reinflection task,  we created   an AGREE-SUBJECT training   set   and   an AGREE-RECENT training  set.   For  each  of  these four training sets, we trained 100 sequential GRUs and 100 Tree/Tree GRUs, all without attention. Results are below.</p>

Perhaps more important than the high accuracy is the consistency across tasks: On both question-formation datasets, the tree-based model got 96% full-sentence accuracy on the test set (<span class="demo" onclick="tab11 = tab11_question;document.getElementById('unamb_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Any question formation'; p11_dataset = experiments_11;  set_param(tab11_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab11_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); p11_column_div = 'columns_p11_question'; hide('columns_p11_tense'); toggle_p11_column(); p11_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab11, 'p11question'); table_11_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_11_div_test_full_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab11); p11question_test_full.checked = true; draw_p11_boxplot('test_full'); ">click here to see in plot</span>), and on both tense-reinflection datasets it got 95% (<span class="demo" onclick="tab11 = tab11_tense;document.getElementById('unamb_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Any tense reinflection'; p11_dataset = experiments_11_tense;  set_param(tab11_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab11_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); p11_column_div = 'columns_p11_tense'; hide('columns_p11_question'); toggle_p11_column(); p11_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab11, 'p11tense'); table_11_div_tense_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_11_div_tense_test_full_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab11); p11tense_test_full.checked = true; draw_p11_boxplot('test_full'); ">click here to see in plot</span>).

These results show that both types of models are equally capable of learning hierarchically-based rules and sequentially-based rules; thus, the preferences we have observed above (that is, the preference of sequential models for linear generalizations and the preference of tree models for hierarchical generalizations) are biases rather than constraints.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Tree structure vs. tree information</h2>

        <p>Our  sequential  and  tree-based  models  differ  not only in structure but also in the information they have been provided:  the tree-based models have been given correct parse trees for their input and output  sentences,   while  the  sequential  models have not been given parse information. Therefore, it is unclear whether the hierarchical generalization displayed by the tree-based models arose from the tree-based model structure, from the parse information provided to the models, or both.</p>

        <p>To  disentangle  these  factors,  we  ran  two  further experiments. First, we retrained the Tree/Tree GRU but using uniformly right-branching trees instead  of  correct  parses. Thus, these models make use of tree structure but not  the  kind  of  parse  structure  that  captures  lin-guistic information. Second, we retrained the sequential GRU without attention but modified theinput and output by adding brackets that indicatee ach sentence’s parse.  Thus, these models are provided with parse information in the input but such structure does not guide the neural network computation as it does with tree RNNs.

        <p>Some highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On tense reinflection, adding brackets to the GRU's input had little discernible effect; if anything it gave it an even stronger sequential preference (possibly because adding brackets increased the distance between the verb and its subject).(<span class="demo" onclick="tab12 = tab12_tense;document.getElementById('info_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Tense reinflection'; p12_dataset = experiments_12_tense;  set_param(tab12_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'GRU', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'GRU', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_question, 'parse', 'Any parse type', 'info_parse_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'parse', 'Any parse type', 'info_parse_btn'); p12_column_div = 'columns_p12_tense'; hide('columns_p12_question'); toggle_p12_column(); p12_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab12, 'p12tense'); table_12_div_tense_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_12_div_tense_gen_mv_correct_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab12); p12tense_gen_mv_correct.checked = true; draw_p12_boxplot('gen_mv_correct'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)</li>
            <li>On question formation, adding brackets did improve its generalization. However, it remains below chance (50%), so these brackets were still not enough to give it hierarchical generalization despite pushing it in that direction.(<span class="demo" onclick="tab12 = tab12_question;document.getElementById('info_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p12_dataset = experiments_12;  set_param(tab12_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'GRU', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'GRU', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_question, 'parse', 'Any parse type', 'info_parse_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'parse', 'Any parse type', 'info_parse_btn'); p12_column_div = 'columns_p12_question'; hide('columns_p12_tense'); toggle_p12_column(); p12_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab12, 'p12question'); table_12_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_12_div_gen_main_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab12); p12question_gen_main.checked = true; draw_p12_boxplot('gen_main'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)</li>
            <li>On both tasks, the Tree-GRU give right-branching trees generalized poorly. (<span class="demo" onclick="tab12 = tab12_question;document.getElementById('info_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Question formation'; p12_dataset = experiments_12;  set_param(tab12_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_question, 'parse', 'No correct parses provided', 'info_parse_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'parse', 'No correct parses provided', 'info_parse_btn'); p12_column_div = 'columns_p12_question'; hide('columns_p12_tense'); toggle_p12_column(); p12_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab12, 'p12question'); table_12_div_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_12_div_gen_main_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab12); p12question_gen_main.checked = true; draw_p12_boxplot('gen_main'); ">click here to see in plot</span>)
                (<span class="demo" onclick="tab12 = tab12_tense;document.getElementById('info_task_btn').innerHTML = 'Tense reinflection'; p12_dataset = experiments_12_tense;  set_param(tab12_question, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'recurrent_unit', 'Tree', 'unamb_enc_btn'); set_param(tab12_question, 'parse', 'No correct parses provided', 'info_parse_btn'); set_param(tab12_tense, 'parse', 'No correct parses provided', 'info_parse_btn'); p12_column_div = 'columns_p12_tense'; hide('columns_p12_question'); toggle_p12_column(); p12_button_selection(); uncheck_all(tab12, 'p12tense'); table_12_div_tense_recurrent_unit_btn.checked = true; table_12_div_tense_gen_mv_correct_btn.checked = true; drawTable(tab12); p12tense_gen_mv_correct.checked = true; draw_p12_boxplot('gen_mv_correct'); ">click here to see in plot</span>) </li>
            <li>These results show two things:</li>
            <li>The failure of the brackets in the input to do stuff shows that giving a model parse information alone is insufficient; the tree structure must be built into the model's computations, as it is in the Tree-GRU.</li>
            <li>However, it is not enough to just have any trees built in, as the Tree-GRU with right-branching trees shows; it must have the correct trees.
        </ul>


        <h2>Multitask learning</h2>

        <p>Each experiment discussed so far involved a sin-gle linguistic transformation. By contrast, humansacquiring language are not exposed to phenomena in isolation but rather to a complete language en-compassing many phenomena. This fact has beenpointed to as a possible way to explain hierarchicalgeneralization in humans without needing to pos-tulate any innate preference for hierarchical struc-ture.   While  one  phenomenon,  such  as  questionformation, might be ambiguous in the input, theremight be enough direct evidence among other phe-nomena to conclude that the language as a wholeis hierarchical, a fact which learners can then ex-tend to the ambiguous phenomenon (Pullum andScholz, 2002; Perfors et al., 2011), under the non-trivial assumption that the learner will choose totreat the disparate phenomena in a unified fashion. Therefore, perhaps a training setup that includes more phenomena than just a single ambiguous one can lead to better generalization on the ambiguous phenomenon.</p>

        <p>To take a first step toward investigating this pos-sibility, we use a multi-task learning setup, wherewe train a single model to perform both questionformation  and  tense  reinflection.   We  set  up  thetraining set such that one task was unambiguouslyhierarchical  while  the  other  was  ambiguous  be-tween the hierarchical generalization and the lin-ear  generalization.   This  gave  two  settings:  Onewhere  question  formation  was  ambiguous,  andone where tense reinflection was ambiguous.  In addition, one major way in which the two tasks differ is that all question formation examples use auxiliary verbs (e.g., <em>My walrus <b>does giggle</b></em>) while all tense reinflection sentences use inflected verbs (e.g., <em>My walrus <b>giggles</b></em>). In case this disparity makes the tasks too different to enable cross-phenomenon generalization, we also created a third condition of multi-task learning with auxiliary verbs added to the tense reinflection examples to make them more similar to question formation. We trained 100 instances of a GRU without attentionon each setting and assessed how each model generalized for the task that was ambiguous.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <h3>Main takeaways</h3>

        We have found that all factors we tested can qualitatively affect a model’s inductive biases but that a hierarchical bias&emdash;which has been argued to underlie children’s acquisition of syntax&emdash;only arose in a model whose inputs and computations were governed by syntactic structure.

        <h3>Relation to human language acquisition</h3>

        <p>Our  experiments  showed  that  some  tree-basedmodels displayed a hierarchical bias,  while non-tree-based  models  never  displayed  such  a  bias,even when provided with strong cues to hierarchi-cal structure in their input (through bracketing ormulti-task learning).  These findings suggest thatthe  hierarchical  preference  displayed  by  humanswhen acquiring English requires making explicitreference  to  hierachical  structure,  and  cannot  beargued  to  emerge  from  more  general  biases  ap-plied to input containing cues to hierarchical struc-ture.</p>

        <p>Moreover, since the only successful hierar-chical model was one that took the correct parsetrees as input, our results suggest that a child’s setof biases includes biases governing which specifictrees will be learned. Such biases could involve in-nate knowledge of likely tree structures, but theydo  not  need  to;  they  might  instead  involve  in-nate tendencies to bootstrap parse trees from othersources,  such  as  prosody  (Morgan  and  Demuth 1996) or semantics (Pinker, 1996).  With such in-formation,  children  might  learn  their  language’sbasic syntax before beginning to acquire questionformation,  and  this  knowledge  might  then  guidetheir acquisition of question formation.</p>

        <p>There are three important caveats for extendingour  conclusions  to  humans.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>humans  mayhave  a  stronger  bias  to  share  processing  acrossphenomena  than  neural  networks  do,  in  whichcase multi-task learning would be a viable expla-nation  for  the  biases  displayed  by  humans  eventhough it had little effect on our models.  Indeed,this sort of cross-phenomenon consistency is sim-ilar in spirit to the principle of systematicity, and ithas long been argued that humans have a strongbias  for  systematicity  while  neural  networks  donot  (e.g.,  Fodor  and  Pylyshyn,  1988;  Lake  andBaroni,  2018).  </li>
            <li>ome  have  argued  thatchildren’s  input  actually  does  contain  utterancesunambiguously supporting a hierarchical transfor-mation  (Pullum  and  Scholz,  2002),  whereas  wehave assumed a complete lack of such examples.</li>
            <li>our  training  data  omit  many  cues  to  hi-erarchical structure that are available to children,including prosody and real-world grounding.  It ispossible that,  with data closer to a child’s input,more general inductive biases might succeed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>However, there is still significant value in study-ing  what  can  be  learned  from  strings  alone,  be-cause we are unlikely to understand how the multi-ple components of a child’s input interact withouta  better  understanding  of  each  component.   Fur-thermore,  during  the  acquisition  of  abstract  as-pects of language, real-world grounding is not al-ways  useful  in  the  absence  of  linguistic  biases(Gleitman  and  Gleitman,  1992).More  gener-ally, it is easily possible for learning to be harderwhen  there  is  more  information  available  thanwhen there is less information available (Dupoux,2018).    Thus,  our  restricted  experimental  setupmay actually make learning easier than in the moreinformationally-rich scenario faced by children</p>

        <h3>Practical takeaways</h3>

        <p>Our  results  leave  room  for  three  possible  approaches to imparting a model with a hierarchical bias.</p>

        <p>First, one could search the space of hyperparameters and random seeds to find a setting that leads to the desired generalization.  However, this may be ineffective:  At least in our limited exploration of these factors, we did not find a hyperparameter setting that led to hierarchical generalization across tasks for any non-tree-based model. A more principled search, such as one using meta-learning, might be more promising.</p>

        <p>A second option is to add a pre-training task or use multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Enguehard et al., 2017), where the  additional  task  is  designed  to  highlight  hierarchical structure.  Most of our multi-task experiments only achieved modest improvements over the  single-task  setting,  suggesting  that  this  approach is also not very viable. However, it is possible that further secondary tasks would bring further gains, making this approach more effective.</p>

        <p>A final option is to use more interpretable architectures with explicit hierachical structure. Our results suggest that this approach is the most viable, as it yielded models that reliably generalized hierarchically. However, this approach only worked when  the  architectural  bias  was  augmented  with rich  assumptions  about  the  input  to  the  learner, namely that the input provided correct hierarchical parses for  all  sentences.   We  leave  for  future  work  an investigation of how to effectively use tree-based models without providing correct parses.</p>
