**Recursion:** [This page](https://rtmccoy.com/fun/recursion.html) lists my favorite examples of recursion.

**Talk about crosswords and linguistics:** In October 2020, I gave a talk for the National Museum of Language called "Language Squared: The Linguistics of Crosswords." You can view the full talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Lhir9eKyY) and can view highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwbO8HMrOq4).

**Published crosswords:** As a hobby, I construct crossword puzzles. I have published 35 puzzles in the *New York Times* (solution grids to all the puzzles are [here](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Tom+McCoy), but spoiler alert in case you want to solve them! And [here](https://www.xwordinfo.com/WordsByCon?author=Tom+McCoy) are the words that I debuted in the *New York Times*). I have also published crosswords in the *New Yorker*, the *Los Angeles Times*, the *Chronicle of Higher Education*, and *Buzzfeed*.

**Johns Hopkins crossword:** In 2019, I constructed [a crossword puzzle](https://thankyou.jhu.edu/2019/) for Johns Hopkins University as part of the President's annual message of thanks to the community. Some press coverage of the crossword:

* [JHU HUB](https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/12/12/tom-mccoy-crossword-puzzlemaker/)
* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/12/27/puzzling-over-language-computational-linguistics-researcher-crafts-crossword-johns-hopkins/#comments-wrapper) (behind a paywall)

**Phonetic crossword:** This puzzle must be completed entirely in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). [[puzzle](http://rtmccoy.com/crosswords/changing_places_xword.pdf)] [[solution](http://rtmccoy.com/crosswords/changing_places_answers.pdf)]

**Phonetic Scrabble:** Antonio Martinez and I made a set of wooden scrabble tiles in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) based on counts from Gretchen McCulloch. Here are some [pictures of it](https://allthingslinguistic.com/post/116416236538/these-ipa-scrabble-pictures-are-courtesy-of-tom) on Gretchen McCulloch's blog.


**Miscellaneous fun facts:**
- Al Roker once described me as "sick and diabolical" (at 58:40 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NZ3cTM9WqU&t=566s)).
- There is a restaurant in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, that sounds like my name. It's called Atomic Koi.
