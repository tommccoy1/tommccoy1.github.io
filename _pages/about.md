I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, advised by [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php). Starting in January 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Linguistics](https://ling.yale.edu/) at Yale University. Before coming to Princeton, I received a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, co-advised by [Tal Linzen](http://tallinzen.net/) and [Paul Smolensky](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/paul-smolensky/), and before that I received a B.A. in Linguistics at Yale University, advised by [Robert Frank](https://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank).

**Research:** I study computational linguistics using techniques from cognitive science, machine learning, and natural language processing. My research focuses on understanding the computational principles that underlie human language. I am particularly interested in learning and representations. On the side of learning, I investigate how people can acquire language from so little data and how we can replicate this ability in machines. On the side of representations, I investigate what types of machines can represent the structure of language and how they do it. Much of my research involves neural network language models, with an emphasis on connecting such systems to linguistics.

If you want an even more detailed discussion, you can read [this summary for a linguistics/cognitive science audience](https://rtmccoy.com/files/mccoy_ling_research_statement_10sept2023.pdf) or [this summary for a computer science audience](https://rtmccoy.com/files/mccoy_nlp_research_statement_10sept2023.pdf), or check out [my publications](https://rtmccoy.com/pubs/).

**Prospective PhD students, postdocs, and undergraduate researchers:** I will be considering PhD applications and postdoc applications for Fall 2024, through either the Yale Linguistics Department or the Yale Computer Science Department. See [here](https://rtmccoy.com/prospective_students_and_postdocs/) for more information.

**Conversation topics:** Do you have a meeting scheduled with me but don't know what to talk about? See [this page](https://rtmccoy.com/topics/) for some topics that are often on my mind.
