		<h1>Recursion</h1>

                <p><em>By Tom McCoy</em></p>


                <p>This page lists my favorite examples of recursion. I take <em>recursion</em> to mean "having an item of category X inside another item of category X." (This definition is the standard one in linguistics. It differs from the computer science notion of recursion, which refers to having a process call itself, but the concepts are related: Linguistics-style recursion is one potential result of computer-science-style recursion. For discussion of the definition of recursion, see <a href="https://rtmccoy.com/fun/recursion.html">this page</a>).</p>

                <h3>Recursion in geography</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><em>Countries within countries:</em> San Marino and Vatican City are both entirely surrounded by Italy. Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa.</li>
                    <li><em>Dahala Khagrabari:</em> Until 2015, there was a territory of India inside a territory of Bangladesh inside a territory of India inside a territory of Bangladesh. The innermost territory was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahala_Khagrabari">Dahala Khagrabari</a>. Below is a map of Dahala Khagrabari from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahala_Khagrabari">Wikipedia</a>

                    </li>
                    <li><em>Recursive islands and lakes:</em> A recursive island occurs when an island contains a lake that contains an island. A recursive lake occurs when a lake contains an island that contains a lake. Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_islands_and_lakes">Wikipedia</a>, there are several examples of an island within an island within an island, and there is one example of a lake within a lake within a lake. Below is a map from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_Royale_National_Park">Wikipedia</a> of Isle Royale, an island within Lake Superior that contains several lakes of its own.

                <h3>Siphonaptera</h3>

                <p>Augustus De Morgan (a logician known for De Morgan's laws) wrote the following poem, entitled <em>Siphonaptera</em>:

                <blockquote>Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,<br>
                And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so <em>ad infinitum</em>.<br>
                And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on; <br>
                While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on.<br></blockquote>
